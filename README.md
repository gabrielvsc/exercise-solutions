# 🖥️ Exercises Solutions
A repository showcasing my solutions to LeetCode and CodeForces problems. While I use multiple programming languages, Python is often my preferred choice due to its simplicity and minimal boilerplate. Occasionally, I follow the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) for structured practice and progression.
